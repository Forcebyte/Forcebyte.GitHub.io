A Readarr and Calibre-Web service that allows me to manage a eBook library using .epubs I have online A AdGuard DNS endpoint with scraping and logging disabled, to reduce tracking from upstream AdGuard DNS servers (this is a bit flawed, as AdGuard DNS has a fairly okay privacy policy overall, but its still a nice-to-have to be able to customize some special DNS blocking for social media trackers or specific bad habits I want to avoid (i.</description></item><item><title>ShikataLab v2 - [Part 2]: ARM and Steam-Server Support</title><link>https://forcebyte.github.io/posts/2025-05-11-shikata-homelab-steam/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 11:30:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://forcebyte.github.io/posts/2025-05-11-shikata-homelab-steam/</guid><description>The Challenge I&amp;rsquo;m starting to hit the issue more and more where my friends and I want to play games that are primarily compiled for ARM; in general, this isn&amp;rsquo;t usually a challenge, but specific to games like Counter-Strike 2 it seems impossible to run without a lot of fuss outside of Docker
The &amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;solution&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; In the past, using stuff like Wine or Proton solved a lot of these problems for me; specifically running things like QEMU within my box to be able to emulate simple programs</description></item><item><title>ShikataLab v1 [Part 2]: Networking</title><link>https://forcebyte.github.io/posts/2021-17-01-shikata-homelab-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jan 2021 11:30:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://forcebyte.github.io/posts/2021-17-01-shikata-homelab-2/</guid><description>So the main issue i&amp;rsquo;ve been sort-of experiencing with my lab is the desire to deploy and maintain items on a completely segregated network
Approaches aside; the ideal scenario would be something like this:
To implement, we will use a simple combination of ProxMox Virtual Networking and a deployment of OPNSense, a external firewall and routing platform based on Free-BSD
Creating our virtual networks This part is fairly simple; create a separate virtual network.</description></item><item><title>ShikataLab v1 [Part 1]: Overarching Choises</title><link>https://forcebyte.github.io/posts/2021-16-01-shikata-homelab-1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jan 2021 23:30:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://forcebyte.github.io/posts/2021-16-01-shikata-homelab-1/</guid><description>Preamble Upon first browsing the plethora of Self-Hosted applications over at the SelfHosted Reddit - i&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to build a home appliance lab for making and deploying custom applications exposed locally to my network. Most people inside of my household have a Technology background (two Full-Stack developers and one DevOps Engineer) - so the most self-fulfilling option is to have a Homelab that&amp;hellip;
Provides an easy-to-manage testing ground for POC&amp;rsquo;ing various services; Either in a containerized environment or via a simple compute virtualization platform Allows for easy cleanup and cost-efficient measures; (I am VERY cheap and VERY bad with leaving cloud-services running and incurring a huge bill; so the various Cloud-Hosted Solutions such Hosting on Astroids, RackSpace Solutions or a major cloud provider are not something I want to trek into for home development purposes Can act as an easy-to-expose option for deployment and management of containers Choosing a proper Virtualization solution From this; there are three main &amp;lsquo;Compute-Based&amp;rsquo; easy to setup solutions that exist (hardware aside)</description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://forcebyte.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jan 2021 17:51:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://forcebyte.github.io/about/</guid><description>I am a Site Reliability Engineer based in Toronto with some Coding / Operations Experience
