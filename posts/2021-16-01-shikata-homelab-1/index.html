Most setup is simplistic and first-time running is super easy and doesn&rsquo;t require any real changes under the hood to get what I want</li><li><strong>Easy to manage UI interface</strong>: compared to the other services I&rsquo;ve used it appears that VMWare has the most &lsquo;modern&rsquo; sort of flash Web-Ui interfaces to use</li><li><strong>Work experience with the platform</strong>: it sounds silly, but having some experience with these types of products, even in a homelab setting, are super helpful to demonstrate in an interview or in your resume. Since vSphere / VMWare products are common in an enterprise setting, it will probably come up often if looking at getting a Sysadmin / SysOps position</li><li><strong>Tons of Sysadmin-Aimed Documentation</strong>: since VMWare is a commonly sought out solution for sysadmins, there are a TON of working environments that are probably similar to what you are developing on. This means that most errors / failures you occur in the platform have some documentation / StackOverflow page somewhere detailing a step-by-step pattern to finding a solution</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li><strong>HUGE License costs</strong>: unless you want to dawn a pirated cracked ISO; I have no real moral quarrels with this but its still something to consider if you wish to use this platform. (Side note: Most tech-related Universities or Colleges have some sort of student trial / discount program with VMWare as part of licensing; either via <a href=https://onthehub.com/>OnTheHub</a> or some sort of student-membership program, but vSphere and ESXI hosts are &lsquo;discounted&rsquo; instead of a fully fledged trial license)</li><li><strong>Lack of intuitive API / code-based automation</strong>: I find this a super niche take for most people attempting to develop with VMWare, however a good chunk of their API&rsquo;s are locked to the &lsquo;Cloud Only&rsquo; license tiers of VMWare. Its somewhat annoying and kind of of contribute to the anti-automation sentiment that most vendors have with their products (See the <a href=https://sso.tax/>SSO Tax</a> for an example of this). VMWare HAS gotten better at this, adding some <a href=https://blogs.vmware.com/code/2017/02/02/getting-started-vsphere-automation-sdk-rest/>Postman samples</a> and <a href=https://vdc-download.vmware.com/vmwb-repository/dcr-public/0f65c3a3-6dc6-4b08-be6c-e17bc3224484/a62d7b78-8d1b-4b41-941f-2acbc6ef0594/vsphere-web-services-sdk-67-developer-setup-guide.pdf>Developer Guides</a> - but having an API that has holes between what a user can do via UI in your service is annoying at best and detrimental at worst. On TOP of this, Prometheus / OpenMetrics / ANY OTHER STANDARD that you want to expose via vSphere is not doable out of the box</li></ul><h3 id=virtualbox>VirtualBox</h3><p>I&rsquo;ve actually used this in the past in my original Homelab (nicknamed &lsquo;Honba&rsquo;) - This along with other Virtualization platforms (Hyper-V for example) aim to expose specific web endpoints and use an external HTTP Web-Server to scrape and push data to your actual compute-node. All of the Virtualization platforms mentioned above do this to some extent, but VirtualBox is the most apparent of all of these, installation is a separate configuration, aptly named <a href=https://www.itzgeek.com/how-tos/virtualization/manage-virtualbox-with-phpvirtualbox-web-based-interface.html>phpVirtualBox</a></p><p>Its a neat first-time-setup type of deployment; however I don&rsquo;t see this used in any enterprise environments that i&rsquo;ve been in; mainly due to its upkeep and lack of HA/DR.</p><p>On to the pros/Cons then..</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li><strong>Community Maintained</strong>: This was probably the best part about when I first stumbled upon this; VirtualBox</li><li><strong>SideCar availability</strong>: By default,</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li><strong>Really janky installation</strong>: This may be due to Oracle being bad at providing a good support framework to VirtualBox for developers, but the setup and installation of this program on to a web server is the most un-intuitive i&rsquo;ve experienced, the versions of dependencies are super old, and do not work on newer versions of VirtualBox (past version <em>6.1</em>)</li><li><strong>HUGE Dependency issues</strong>: The primary things I wanted to do with my homelab (Network separation, NACL configuration, and Honeypotting) are limited by the functionality of VirtualBox; virtual switches and config are un-intuitive at best and are not recommended</li><li><strong>Random UI/UX Problems</strong>: Because this is essentially a connector to your main VirtualBox compute platform, things like API limiting on the VirtualBox instance, along with various server-side issues lead to a deployment pattern that causes random bugs. This isn&rsquo;t a huge issue at first glance but leads to a real</li></ul><h3 id=xen-project--xenserver>Xen Project // XenServer</h3><p>I haven&rsquo;t heard of many people running this in a homelab-like environment in a while, but Xen Project was one of the main names other than vSphere and ProxMox being mentioned by most people I know; The biggest benefit of this is using an open-source like platform that has a branched enterprise version (either XenServer or Huawei UVP) if needed. Its uncommon to see this used as much as vSphere but it is useful from a background perspective</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li><strong>Work Experience with the Platform</strong>: Similar to vSphere, Xen Project / Citrix Hypervisor is used a ton in the Enterprise space for its ability to be seamlessly managed. Although its not as used (in my experience) to the vSphere monalith that exists in most companies today; its still somewhat important to note. Its also very important to note that larger-scale Cloud Providers (E.g. AWS) <a href=https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/aws-just-announced-a-move-from-xen-towards-kvm-so-what-is-kvm/>have used these virtualization platforms in the past</a> - so it may be still useful to pin a homelab using these technologies for experience alone</li><li><strong>Open Sourced:</strong> Similar to Proxmox, the entire virtualization platform is based on open sourced virtualization standard (XEN). This allows for more documentation and more real-world applications compared to other environments (additionally, the skills transfer over very well to plain libvert / qemu KVM enterprise businesses)</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li><strong>Feature Set</strong>: One of the biggest gripes i&rsquo;ve had with XenServer is the lack of KVM, which in my homelab is somewhat of a requirement for me. <a href=https://www.citrix.com/content/dam/citrix/en_us/documents/products-solutions/citrix-xenserver-industry-leading-open-source-platform-for-cost-effective-cloud-server-and-desktop-virtualization.pdf>Paravirtualization</a> is still a large selling point of using built-in XEN architecture instead of QEMU/KVM alternatives, however most of my use-cases will run containerized, and in addition I want containers to be directly managed from the Hypervisor&rsquo;s web UI instead of via a third party install on a VM (E.g. Portainer or Kube-UI)</li><li><strong>Not as widely adopted</strong>: Although minor, its an important point to note that there are less open-sourced users that actively use Xen Project compared to other open sourced standards, this wouldn&rsquo;t be a huge issue in an enterprise sense, but for the amount of time you&rsquo;d want to dedicate to learning a technology for HomeLab purposes its something to note.</li></ul><h3 id=proxmox>Proxmox</h3><p>Best for last, I guess. A little bit of background here; Proxmox was my third &lsquo;enterprise virtualization&rsquo; platform that I used after vSphere and VirtualBox, I was mainly looking for a better way to develop and learn host to setup and host services to benefit my real work at the time.</p><p>By far Proxmox has blown me away with how much it fits my needs, Containerization is nice, the Web UI (although VERY depreciated at times) works for what I need it for, and the API is workable at least</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li><strong>Mirror-Like Feature Set</strong>: Compared to other platforms, proxmox almost has complete feature parity</li><li><strong>Built-in Containerization Support</strong>: This one is big for me; most people that use my Homelab today only want to spin up dumb builds of projects that persist on a server that takes up less than 2GB of RAM, containerization is a beautiful way of doing this however there are a lot of hoops you&rsquo;d normally have to jump through for Persistent Volumes or KVM passthrough. Proxmox handles this <em>Beautifully</em> - we are able to deploy simple long-lasting containers from Proxmox&rsquo;s API and UI easily</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li><strong>Kind of a Bad API</strong>: This is more a personal gripe than anything else, one of the problems that I&rsquo;ve noticed with the ProxMox API is (similar to vSphere) the lack of proper API documentation. This has gotten WAY better in recent years with their <a href=https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/api-viewer/#/access>API Viewer</a> - but its fairly unintuative compared to people who have worked with better API strategies. For example; when executing remote backup jobs via GitHub Actions or via locally hosted GitLab, its common to require 4-5 separate API calls to get the information you need for a specific container (or VMs) context / ID before doing a single call to backup to external storage. Comparing this to something like a classic <code>vzdump</code> of your instance makes this very undesirable.</li><li><strong>UI isn&rsquo;t as nice</strong>: Its been <a href=https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/better-web-ui-for-proxmox-a-suggestion.9704/>mentioned</a> quite a few times and <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/auc9df/my_attempt_at_a_dark_theme_for_the_proxmox_web_ui/>some attempts</a> at improving the API, but its safe to say that the built-in API that comes with Proxmox isn&rsquo;t as nice as vSphere.</li><li><strong>Very low-level physical host</strong>: Again, more of a personal gripe; proxmox uses a <code>Node -> Datacenter</code> model, which has a ton of benefits and availability for HA/DR, however most remote management of specific nodes aren&rsquo;t really doable without individually launching a SPICE session inside of the ProxMox UI. This, compared to <a href=https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.html.hostclient.doc/GUID-31C1864C-5B1A-4586-947E-96E984B8F23C.html>vSpheres UI + API based method</a> that <em>doesn&rsquo;t require</em> access to nodes to accomplish tasks is annoying at best, and cumbersome at worst</li></ul><h3 id=final-choices>Final Choices</h3><p>With all that said, I came to the decision to use ProxMox as my Homelab platform due to its simplicity and resource-light virtualization layer</p><p><img src=/assets/2021-16-01-shikata-homelab-1/homelab-pic.png alt="HomeLab
